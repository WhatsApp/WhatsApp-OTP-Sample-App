# WhatsApp One-Time Password (OTP) Sample App 

This sample app demonstrates how to send and receive OTP codes through WhatsApp Business APIs and how to integrate with our 'one-tap' autofill and copy code functionality.

The `Server` folder provides the necessary resources to create a template and set up a sample server that can be used in conjunction with the `Android`and `iOS` apps. Each folder contains a comprehensive `README` file with detailed instructions.

For a high-level overview, please consult our [API docs on authentication templates](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/authentication-templates).
